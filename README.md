# Neuroflow Assignment


## Running Program

For problem 1 of the assignment I used Jupyter Notebook to write and run python code to make some analysis on the data supplied. To run the code you would need the Jupyter Notebook IDE. You could download the ipynb file as well as the csv file and the code should run in the IDE. Make sure the csv file and .ipynb file are in the same folder, so the data can be properly downloaded into the program. 


## Problem 1

### Given the information you have and any light research you’d like to do on the topic, what insights can you draw? 

### What assumptions have you made about the data? 

The 'mood'and 'sleep' categories have highest frequency in the data. Meaning people are using these apps mostly to track their moods and sleep. Because the frequency of these categories within the data is high, the sample of data is larger meaning you can probably get more accurate insight from this data. 

The average score between all types are all similar ranging around just below a 2.5, histograms show similar score ranges for each type. We want to continue tracking this data to see if over time the averages can increase.

Looking at the line graphs we can see changes in average over time as well as 

Looking at the line graphs we can also see changes in count(the frequency of types within the data) over time. meaning probably more  users are using the app so positive increase in product activity 


### What are 2-3 additional pieces of information that would be important to collect? 

I believe there will most likely be a database for users that contains more in depth information about each user. I think some other factors unique to users such as the users age, weight, residency, etc. could also affect their health and how they rate or score each category. If we combined the tables based on the user_id we can compare statistics in the user database to the statistics in the subj_measures file ande see if any other factors like weight, age, gender is correlated to how users rate each category. For example, I’d like to compare things like age and the scores in each category, or maybe even gender. When doing these comparisons I believe we can find some more valuable insight on the subject. Also relating users past medical history (like if they have other mental, emotional, physical health issues or take any medication which can influence their health) could be used and compared when looking at this data and can also give a deeper insight in to the data, the users, and how the company can help.


## Problem 2

The neuroflow.sql file has the two sql queries for the second part of the assignment
